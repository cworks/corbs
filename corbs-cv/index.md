##Thanks!

I appreciate you taking a gander at the course of my professional life, yet at the same time I apologize because you’ll never get these fleeting 2 minutes back.

I love what I do and enjoy working with people to build useful things...I never grew out of playing with Legos but since a grown man can't do that all day (wait can he?) I decided to build stuff with software.

I've spent the last 10 years either managing a development group or working as a software Architect.  Currently I'm working as the Chief Architect at Apptricity where things are going well and we're making some great apps.  Regardless of the role, what I really enjoy is coding and I strive to code each day, even if just for fun...I hope to never go "post-technical".

So what can I say except I’m fortunate and thankful for my career, every unique twist and turn, every venti-double-cup-no-room, every pound your head on the desk moment, every ah-ha moment, every early morning, every late night, every spirited discussion, every manager and every colleague.

My professional goal has been and will always be to work smart and hard, to learn from others, lead by example and excite those around me to do good work.  My aim is to constantly T.H.I.N.K...That is to say what is true, helpful, important, necessary and kind.

I'm happily employed but always interested in learning about new challenges so feel free to drop me a line!
